# DinoPopulation
This project was inspired by Michael Crichton's iconic novel Jurassic Park, which masterfully blends science, technology, and adventure. The novel explores the thrilling idea of a dinosaur-filled park managed with cutting-edge technology, where every detail matters—from species tracking to containment. Captivated by the depth of Crichton’s world, I was inspired to create a Java-based dinosaur population management system. This project simulates the challenges of dynamically tracking species populations using object-oriented principles and scalable data structures. It aims to provide a glimpse into how such a system could function in a real-world scenario, while also being an engaging exercise in software design.

## Dinosaur Population Management System

A Java-based system to simulate the detection and tracking of various dinosaur species in a park. This system uses `ArrayList` for dynamic population management and follows object-oriented design principles to ensure clarity, scalability, and modularity.

### Key Features:
- **Dinosaur Species Management**: Enum to define and track various species (T-Rex, Velociraptor, etc.).
- **Detection Methods**: Interface and concrete implementations for different dinosaur detection techniques (e.g., Camera, RFID).
- **Population Management**: Use of `ArrayList` to dynamically manage dinosaur populations and species count.
- **Scalability and Extensibility**: Easily extendable for new species and detection methods.

### Technologies:
- Java
- Object-Oriented Design (OOP)
- Enum, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces for modular architecture

This system offers a flexible, extensible solution for managing and simulating dinosaur populations in a dynamic environment.
